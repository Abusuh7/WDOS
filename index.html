<hr>
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>
       Sri Lanka, originally Ceylon, is an Indian Ocean island republic separated from peninsular India by the Palk Strait.
       Sri Lanka has also been influenced by the cultures of other Asian civilizations.
       Taprobane was the name given to it by ancient Greek geographers. Serendib was the Arab name for it.
       Later European mapmakers dubbed it Ceylon, a name that is still used in trade today.
       In 1972, it was given the name Sri Lanka.
       Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948, following over 150 years of British rule, and was accepted to the United Nations seven years later.
       The Commonwealth and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation are both members of the country.

           <p style="text-align:left;"><strong> Lanka has been continuously inhabited for almost 2 million years, with the first settlers being Stone Age hunter-gatherers.
             Around the 5th century BCE, Sinhalese immigrants arrived from northern India,
              forming the foundation of the contemporary Sinhalese population. Around two centuries later,
               Tamils from the south of India arrived in Jaffna and established themselves.
                In contrast to the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, the majority of Tamils are Hindu or Christian,
                 and they make up a small minority of Sri Lanka's population. Around Anuradhapura,
                  the fabled north Indian prince Vijaya and his 700 followers landed in Puttallam and established the first Sinhalese kingdom.
                   Buddhism arrived from India in the 3rd century BCE in Mihintale, where Sinhalese King Tissa was converted.
                    Early Buddhist messengers carried a slice from the Bodhi tree, which still stands in Anuradhapura and is a popular pilgrimage destination.
                     Tensions with Tamil kingdoms in India were always present,
                      and a Pandyan invasion in 432 resulted in the capital being established at Sigiriya,
                       a rock fortress.<br><br>
            According to legend,
             King Kassapa built the fortress on top of the rock after murdering his own father.
              After Kassapa's brief reign,
               the capital was returned to Anuradhapura before being relocated to Polonnaruwa in 1070,
                where it remained for the next 150 years. After defying the Portuguese and the Dutch for 300 years,
                 Kandy rose to prominence after the Portuguese arrived in 1505 and became Sri Lanka's only independent kingdom.
                  It fell to the British in 1815 after defying the Portuguese and the Dutch for 300 years.
                   By 1518, the Portuguese had built good ties with the King and were granted permission to erect a fort
                    at Colombo in exchange for the king's protection. Meanwhile, in Galle, the Dutch built a commercial fort,
                     destroying the previous Portuguese garrison.
                      The Dutch East India Company quickly gained control of the majority of Ceylon.</strong>

            Sri Lankan culture has been influenced by a variety of forces,
             but it has managed to retain many of its old characteristics.
              Its ancient history and Buddhist tradition have largely affected it.
               The country has a long and illustrious artistic legacy that includes music, dance,
                and visual arts. Cuisine, festivals, and sports all reflect the Sri Lankan way of life.
                 South Indian influences can be seen in a variety of ways.
                  Sinhala (also known as Sinhalese or Singhalese) is the mother tongue of Sri Lanka's
                   biggest ethnic group, the Sinhalese.
                    It is a member of the Indo-Aryan family of Indo-European languages.
                     In Sri Lanka, around 16 million people speak Sinhala,
                      with roughly 13 million of them being native speakers.
                       Along with Tamil, which has its origins in South India,
                        it is one of Sri Lanka's constitutionally recognized official languages.
                         There are those among them who can speak English fluently.

          Sri Lanka became a plantation economy in the 19th and 20th centuries,
           known for its production and export of cinnamon, rubber, and Ceylon tea,
            which is still a signature national export. Under British administration,
             the island's strategic importance as a trading center was enhanced by the
              establishment of modern ports. From 1948 until 1977,
               the government's economic policies were heavily influenced by socialism.
                Plantations were decommissioned, enterprises were nationalized,
                 and a welfare state was created. The country was exposed to the free market economy in 1977,
                  which included privatization, deregulation,
                   and the development of private enterprise.
                   While the production and export of tea, rubber, coffee, sugar,
                    and other commodities Food manufacturing, textiles, telecommunications,
                     and finance have all grown in prominence as a result of industrialization.
                      Tourism, tea export, textiles, rice production,
                       and other agricultural items are the country's key economic sectors.
                        In addition to these economic sectors, foreign employment,
                         particularly in the Middle East,
                          makes a significant contribution to foreign exchange.
