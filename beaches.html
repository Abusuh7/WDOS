                                Nilaveli Beach is a wide,
                                 sandy beach with palm trees and fishing boats.
                                  It's a 30-minute drive from the city of Trincomalee
                                   in the northeastern area of Sri Lanka.
                                    Because of its own small reef,
                                     this tiny island features tranquil beaches with modest waves.
                                      Despite its size,
                                       Nilaveli's beach is popular with both locals and tourists.
                                        There are lifeguards on duty,
                                         as well as numerous small restaurants along the beach,
                                          the most of which specialize in seafood. <br>
                                          If the isolation of Nilaveli isn't enough,
                                           you can take a boat to Pigeon Island National Park,
                                            about a half-mile off the coast.
                                             This idyllic island is best known for its
                                              snorkeling and scuba diving,
                                               and there is a good diving school near the beach,
                                                as well as a tour operator that provides guided tours of the island.

                                Arugam Bay is dramatically beautiful,
                                 with bright white sand and deep blue
                                  water gradually becoming green the
                                   closer you get to the shore. With
                                    that beauty comes some of the best surf breaks
                                     in Sri Lanka, and the beach is known as an
                                      international surf destination. This reputation
                                       brings many visitors but also means the
                                        area has a good tourist infrastructure
                                         and is easy to access. The curving beach
                                          feels a bit like a Hawaiian beach - the area
                                           near the water slopes down, and there's a dry,
                                            sandy section, then rougher
                                             areas with shrubs and a tree line.

                                Unawatuna is one of the biggest tourist destinations 
                                in Sri Lanka and is the most “famous” beach in the country.
                                 It is a lovely banana-shaped beach of golden sand and turquoise water,
                                  surrounded by green palm trees!
                                It was the first beach we visited in Sri Lanka.
                                 We chose not to stay at one of the fancy and expensive
                                  hotels along the beach of Unawatuna,
                                   but a few kilometers away at a guesthouse.
                                    We walked to the Unawatuna Beach on two separate day trips.
                                Unawatuna and its beach are near the colonial town of Galle,
                                 which is a great city for sightseeing.
                                  Sri Lanka was formerly a colony of both Portugal
                                   and Holland (at different times),
                                    and this was the country's main city during that time.
                                     About five kilometers outside Galle,
                                      Unawatuna offers another little bit of beach paradise.
