                <h2>History-:</h2>
    
                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>
                    It is likely that the area around Sigiriya may have
                    been inhabited since prehistoric times. There is clear
                      evidence that the many rock shelters and caves in the
                       vicinity were occupied by Buddhist monks and ascetics
                        from as early as the 3rd century BC. The earliest
                         evidence of human habitation at Sigiriya is the Aligala
                          rock shelter to the east of Sigiriya rock, indicating
                           that the area was occupied nearly five thousand years
                            ago during the Mesolithic Period. <br><br>
                            Buddhist monastic settlements were established during
                             the 3rd century BC in the western and northern slopes
                              of the boulder-strewn hills surrounding the Sigiriya
                               rock. Several rock shelters or caves were created
                                during this period. These shelters were made under
                                 large boulders, with carved drip ledges around the
                                  cave mouths. Rock inscriptions are carved near the
                                   drip ledges on many of the shelters, recording the
                                    donation of the shelters to the Buddhist monastic
                                     order as residences. These were made in the
                                      period between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st
                                       century AD <br><br>
                                       In 477 AD, Kashyapa I, the king’s son by a non-royal
                                        consort, seized the throne from King Dhatusena,
                                         following a coup assisted by Migara, the King’s
                                          nephew and army commander. The rightful heir, Moggallana,
                                           fearing for his life, fled to South India.
                                            Afraid of an attack by Moggallana, Kashyapa
                                             moved the capital and his residence from the
                                              traditional capital of Anuradhapura to the more
                                               secure Sigiriya. During King Kashyapa’s
                                                reign (477 to 495 AD), Sigiriya was developed
                                                 into a complex city and fortress.Most
                                                  of the elaborate constructions on the rock
                                                   summit and around it, including defensive
                                                    structures, palaces, and gardens, date from
                                                     this period. <br><br>
                                                     The Culavamsa describes King Kashyapa as the son of King
                                                      Dhatusena. Kashyapa murdered his father by walling him
                                                       up alive and then usurping the throne which rightfully
                                                        belonged to his half-brother Moggallana, Dhatusena's
                                                         son by the true queen. Moggallana fled to India to escape
                                                          being assassinated by Kashyapa, but vowed revenge.
                                                           In India he raised an army with the intention of
                                                            returning and retaking the throne of Sri Lanka,
                                                             which he considered to be rightfully his.
                                                              Expecting the inevitable return of Moggallana,
                                                               Kashyapa is said to have built his palace on the
                                                                summit of Sigiriya as a fortress as well as a
                                                                 pleasure palace. Moggallana finally arrived,
                                                                  declared war, and defeated Kashyapa in 495
                                                                   CE. During the battle Kashyapa's armies
                                                                    abandoned him and he committed suicide
                                                                     by falling on his sword. <br><br>
                                                                     The Culavamsa and folklore inform us that the 
                                                                     battle-elephant on which Kashyapa was mounted
                                                                      changed course to take a strategic advantage
                                                                      , but the army misinterpreted the movement as
                                                                       the king's having opted to retreat, prompting
                                                                        the army to abandon him altogether. It is said
                                                                         that being too proud to surrender he took his
                                                                          dagger from his waistband, cut his throat,
                                                                           raised the dagger proudly, sheathed it, and
                                                                            fell dead. Moggallana returned the capital
                                                                             to Anuradhapura, converting Sigiriya into
                                                                              a Buddhist monastery complex, which survived
                                                                               until the 13th or 14th century. After this
                                                                                period, no records are found on Sigiriya
                                                                                 until the 16th and 17th centuries, when
                                                                                  it was used briefly as an outpost of the

                    <p><strong>
                        In 1831 Major Jonathan Forbes of the 78th
                         Highlanders of the British Army, while returning
                          on horseback from a trip to Pollonnuruwa,
                           encountered the "bush covered summit of Sigiriya".
                           Sigiriya came to the attention of antiquarians and,
                            later, archaeologists. Archaeological work at
                             Sigiriya began on a small scale in the 1890s.
                              H.C.P. Bell was the first archaeologist to conduct
                               extensive research on Sigiriya.
                                The Cultural Triangle Project, launched by the
                                 Government of Sri Lanka, focused its attention
                                  on Sigiriya in 1982. Archaeological work
                                   began on the entire city for the first time
                                    under this project. There was a sculpted
                                     lion's head above the legs and paws
                                      flanking the entrance, but the head
                                       collapsed years ago. <br><br>
                                       Sigiriya consists of an ancient citadel
                                        built by King Kashyapa during the 5th
                                         century. The Sigiriya site contains the
                                          ruins of an upper palace located on the
                                           flat top of the rock, a mid-level terrace
                                            that includes the Lion Gate and the mirror
                                             wall with its frescoes, the lower palaces
                                              clings to the slopes below the rocks. The
                                               moats, walls and gardens of the palace extended
                                                for a few hundred metres from the base of the rock.
                                                 The site was both a palace and a fortress. The upper
                                                  palace on the top of the rock includes cisterns cut
                                                   into the rock. <br><br>
                                                   John Still in 1907 wrote, "The whole face of the
                                                    hill appears to have been a gigantic picture gallery...
                                                     the largest picture in the world perhaps".
                                                      The paintings would have covered most of the western
                                                       face of the rock, an area 140 metres long and 40 metres high.
                                                        There are references in the graffiti to 500 ladies
                                                         in these paintings. However, most have been lost forever.
                                                          More frescoes, different from those on the rock face,
                                                           can be seen elsewhere, for example on the ceiling of the location
                                                            called the "Cobra Hood Cave". <br><br>
                                                            Although the frescoes are classified as in the
                                                             Anuradhapura period, the painting style is considered
                                                              unique; the line and style of application of the

                    <h2>Gardens:-</h2>
                    <p><strong>
                        The gardens of Sigiriya are one of the most important aspects of the site, as they are among the oldest landscaped gardens in the world. The gardens are divided into three distinct but linked forms: water gardens, cave and boulder gardens, and terraced gardens.
                    </strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <h3>Some of the famous gardens</h3>
                        <li>Water gardens</li>
                        <li>Boulder gardens</li>
                        <li>Terraced gardens</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>1. Water gardens</h2>
                    <img class="garden" src="images/Water garden.webp" alt="water garden" width="100%">
                    <p><strong>The water gardens can be seen in the central section of the western precinct. Three principal gardens are found here. The first garden consists of a plot surrounded by water. It is connected to the main precinct using four causeways, with gateways placed at the head of each causeway. This garden is built according to an ancient garden form known as char bagh, and is one of the oldest surviving models of this form. <br>
                        The second contains two long, deep pools set on either side of the path. Two shallow, serpentine streams lead to these pools. Fountains made of circular limestone plates are placed here. Underground water conduits supply water to these fountains which are still functional, especially during the rainy season. Two large islands are located on either side of the second water garden. Summer palaces are built on the flattened surfaces of these islands. Two more islands are located farther to the north and the south. These islands are built in a manner similar to the island in the first water garden. <br><br>
                        The third garden is situated on a higher level than the other two. It contains a large, octagonal pool with a raised podium on its northeast corner. The large brick and stone wall of the citadel is on the eastern edge of this garden.
                        The water gardens are built symmetrically on an east-west axis. They are connected with the outer moat on the west and the large artificial lake to the south of the Sigiriya rock. All the pools are also interlinked using an underground conduit network fed by the lake, and connected to the moats. A miniature water garden is located to the west of the first water garden, consisting of several small pools and watercourses. This recently discovered smaller garden appears to have been built after the Kashyapan period, possibly between the 10th and 13th centuries.
                        </strong></p>

                        <h2>2. Boulder gardens</h2>
                        <img class="garden" src="images/Boulder garden (3).webp" alt="Boulder garden" width="100%">
                        <p><strong>The boulder gardens consist of several large boulders linked by winding pathways. The gardens extend from the northern slopes to the southern slopes of the hills at the foot of Sigiris rock. Most of these boulders had a building or pavilion upon them; there are cuttings that were used as footings for brick walls and beams. They were used to be pushed off from the top to attack enemies when they approached.
                        </strong></p>

                        <h2>3. Terraced garden</h2>
                        <img class="garden" src="images/Terraced.webp" alt="terraced garden" width="100%">
                        <p><strong>The terraced gardens are formed from the natural hill at the base of the Sigiriya rock. A series of terraces rises from the pathways of the boulder garden to the staircases on the rock. These have been created by the construction of brick walls, and are located in a roughly concentric plan around the rock. The path through the terraced gardens is formed by a limestone staircase. From this staircase, there is a covered path on the side of the rock, leading to the uppermost terrace where the lion staircase is situated.</strong></p>
